# Recipe-Manager-App
Recipe Manager is an interactive cooking web app built with SimpleKit using a robust MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The system helps users manage recipes and follow instructions step-by-step during cooking. Users can add and delete recipes that include ingredients and structured instructions (bullets, numbers, or dots).
