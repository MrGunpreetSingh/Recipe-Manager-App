**Recipe Manager** is an interactive cooking web app built with SimpleKit using a robust MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
The system helps users manage recipes and follow instructions step-by-step during cooking. Users can add and delete recipes that include ingredients and structured instructions (bullets, numbers, or dots). While category and tag selection are visually present in the UI, and fully modeled in code, those options are not yet functional for user input—each new recipe uses the demo’s defaults.

Why I Chose This Project
Cooking is a universal challenge and organizing recipes is something every home cook benefits from—so this project tackles a practical problem, makes good use of multiple screens/views, and clearly demonstrates the value of MVC structure for maintainability and real-world scale.
